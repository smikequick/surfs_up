## **Project Overview**

### ***Purpose***
The purpose of this project is to assess which time of year is best to open a surf shop and an ice cream store in Oahu. Specfically, data was analyzed around temperature to determine the best option that would be most lucrative for business.

## **Analysis Results**

Statistical data was gather for the months of June and December. Below are two tables that illustrate the differences by month.

The first table shows June data.

The second table shows December data.

Three key differences in temperature between June and Decemeber
* The average temperature in June is approximately 4 degrees warmer than December (i.e. ~75 degrees compared to 71 degrees, respectively).
* The minimum temperature in June (64 degrees) is 8 degrees warmer than the minimum temperature in December (56 degrees). 
* The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees compared to 83 degrees in December.

## **Summary**

Based on the data displayed above, there are a few key differences in temperature when comparing June and December. June tends to be warmer on average than December. Not surprisingly, the minimum temperature in June is 8 degrees warmer than it is in December. Additionally, the maximum temperature in June is 2 degrees warmer than December. Comparing the minimum and maximum temperatures for both months illustrates less temperature variability in the month of June than in the month of December. 

Through two additional queries, data was also gathered for precipition in both months. 

The table below displays June precipitation.

The table below illustrates December precipitation.

Based on these queries, further differences are illuminated in that December tends to be a month with more precipitation than June. This may be another major factor in determining whether or not to open an ice cream shop alongside a surf shop. Through an evaluation of both sets of data, the likely choice would be to open the shops in the month of June due to warmer weather and less likelihood for rain.
